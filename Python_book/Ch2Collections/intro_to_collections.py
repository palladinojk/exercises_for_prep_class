#Exercises
#1. len(people)
#2. 
# stuff = ('hello', 'world', 'bye', 'now')
# other = list(stuff)
# other[2] = 'goodbye'
# stuff = tuple(other)
# print(stuff)
#3. Lists are mutable; tuples are not. Lists use []
#   Tuples use (). Lists and tuples are both the
#   same sequence category. They are ordered/indexed.
#   Lists and tuples are hererogenous taking 
#   different types.
#4.  We can index string characters and they are 
#   ordered. But they are not separate objects.
#5. how do set types differe from the sequence types.
#   Set types do not take duplicates and are unordered.
#   Sequence types take duplicates and are ordered.
#6. str_pi = str(pi)
#7. 0-6 inclusive; 1-5 inclusive; 3,7,11; []; 8-4 inclusive.
#8. print(list(range(3,17,4))) would be 3,7,11,15
#9. 9.1 They are equal in value.
#   9.2 they are a shallow copy so not the same object.
#   9.3 Yes they are equal
#   9.4 They are shallow copy but objects are the same.
#10. It is uncertain. sets of this sort are not ordered
#   but they sometimes will print out in order as a fluke.
#11.
